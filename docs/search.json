    "text": "Ongoing Research\n\nAlternative stable states in sagebrush ecosystems\nI am currently working on several projects looking at alternative stable states of vegetation in sagebrush ecosystems that explore the following questions\n\nHow do fire regime characteristics impact seed dispersal? Preprint here.\nEven without repeated fire, will the grassland state remain?\nHow do invasive annual grasses and forbs interact and coexist?\n\n\n\nLarge-scale studies of native and exotic richness relationships\nWe had a really great “un-conference” before the onset of the pandemic about using National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data. We wrote a paper about how these data can be used for invasion ecology (see Gill et all, below). Now, a few of us from that group are working on looking at expanding one of those case studies across all neon sites.\n\n\nGlobal patterns of fire activity\n\nFiredpy is a python package that downloads satellite burned area data and creates fire perimeters. We are currently updating the code to make it run faster and use less memory. See Balch et al 2020 below for more info on the algorithm.\nWe ran firedpy for every country on earth, and the derived products are on scholar.colorado.edu. See www.github.com/earthlab/firedpy for more details and links to all derived products.\nWe are currently using those products to examine country level fire regimes, and trends in fire activity.\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n2022 Mahood, A.L., Jones, R.O., Board, D.A, Balch, J.K., Chambers, J.C.
